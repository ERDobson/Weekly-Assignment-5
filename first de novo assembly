I started this exercise by following the same directions we used in-class for de novo Assembly 2.  I had used cutadapt on the G11 files on Thursday
afternoon and I just fed them into the same command line for spades.py (with same k-mer choices) as we did there.
Similar for making a quast report.  So far, no glitches beyond syntax problems just getting the commandline right.  I called my output G11
_spades_output.

Here are some results from the graphics:  I used the original html file and not Icarus.
1. 119 contigs
2. GC content=57.89%
3.Largest Contig = 302203.
4. N50 = 110872

My initial thoughts on the quality of the assembly is that it is good.  Before running the G11 data, I opened the quast report for the T1 data
we used as a class example, and it looks very similar to me.  Other observations based on what we discussed in class?  If I'm reading this right
we are representing a total genome of 4,000,000+ base pairs with just 119 total contigs.  That seems to be a reasonable and believeable result.
The N50 I'm less sure about.  It took 110,872 contigs to get to the N50 point.  On over 4,000,000 base pairs that might be good, though
a smaller number there would be good.  The L50 of just 11 builds my confidence more!  It sounds like big chunks match well with perhaps left and
right "ends" that don't as much.  I think we would like to see a longer largest contig, but as a newcomer to this I may be wrong.  

I think it was a successful first run with Quast.  It seems to be a smooth running and forgiving program.  I really expected worse, perhaps
very glitchy results this first time, and this seems to be high quality to me.
